# kahoot-spammer
So after discovering that kahoot had implemented a dual authentification option to stop bots from joining games, I resolved to fix the issue and allow people to ruin learning expiriances once again.

I dont know if I am the first person to implement a solution for this, and I doubt it I am not claiming to be the first, however I havent seen any other github projects that allow bypass of the dual athuentification procedure for kahoot. 

anyways on to the code 

W.I.P im still uploading stuff but im pretty much done with the development for now
